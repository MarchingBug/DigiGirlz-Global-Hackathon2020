We believe in working together to solve problems
What brought us together is being open minded about various subjects
We want to stop the abuse towards children and bullying in any shape or form

We are all here thanks to Alice! 
Great experience from Alice Envisions the Future made us want to try again and do something good for people in need
We wanted to try again and have fun along the way

We are the team of open minded people that want to change the world for the better
Creativity is a key to fun
We believe that technology can help us solve many important problems
We are stronger together!
